			This is a very long and boring paragraph that spans multiple lines.
			Suddenly there is a #[strong strongly worded phrase] that cannot be
			#[em ignored].
		p.
			And here's an example of an interpolated tag with an attribute:
			#[q(lang="es") Â¡Hola Mundo!]

		p
			| If I don't write the paragraph with tag interpolation, tags like
			strong strong
			| and
			em em
			| might produce unexpected results.
		p.
			If I do, whitespace is #[strong respected] and #[em everybody] is happy.
